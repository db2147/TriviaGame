In this project I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manupulate the HTML. 

*The game has multiple choice options using cool radio buttons in the HTML. 

*The player has a limited amount of time  to finish the quiz.  

*The game ends when the time runs out and will reveal how many questions the player answered correctly/incorrectly.

*Test your music knowledge
